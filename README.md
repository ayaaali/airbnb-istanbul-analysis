## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Steps taken to prepare the dataset:

Removed duplicates and unused fields.

Handled missing values (e.g., filled prices with the median).

Standardized columns (dates, currency, categories).

Created new features such as response time categories and review flags.

Final clean dataset stored in the Clean Data tab.

## Analysis Questions

Which neighborhoods have the highest demand for Airbnb listings?

Are there specific neighborhoods or property types that command higher prices?

What is the average review score of competitors in the market?

What is the estimated annual revenue for different property types, based on price and availability?

What types of properties (e.g., entire homes, private rooms) are most popular among guests?

Are superhosts earning more than regular hosts?

## Tools & Methods

Excel: Data cleaning, PivotTables, and charts.

Pivot Analysis: To summarize revenue, occupancy, and demand.

Visualizations: Bar charts, pie charts, and column charts for insights.

## Key Insights

Certain neighborhoods (like the islands and city center) show the highest demand and revenue potential.

Entire homes are the most profitable property type, but private rooms on islands also perform strongly.

Superhosts consistently earn more than regular hosts due to higher trust and booking rates.

Guests prefer entire homes with at least one bedroom and bathroom.

## Recommendations for Investors

Focus on high-demand neighborhoods to maximize occupancy.

Invest in entire homes or private rooms on islands, which bring higher revenue.

Aim for Superhost status by maintaining strong guest experiences.

Use pricing and occupancy data to guide investment decisions.

## Future Work

Automate data updates with Power Query or Python.

Compare Istanbul with other tourist cities.

Add time-series analysis for seasonal demand trends.
